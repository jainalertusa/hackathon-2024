Beautifully landscaped Van Vorst Park, right around the corner, is home to a year round farmers market, playgrounds, and dog parks. Just a mile away is Liberty State Park where tourists and locals alike enjoy the 1200-acre park with sweeping views of Manhattan and Brooklyn, and easy access to the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island and Liberty Science Center. A commuter's dream, the neighborhood is centered around the Grove Street PATH station with trains to NYC and Newark, and is serviced by NJ Transit buses and the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail.",APARTMENT,201 Montgomery St,201 Montgomery St,,Jersey City,NJ,07302,,,,,,71,,2024-04-12,3150000,2005-03-16,8910000,,,,40.717161,-74.043794,"Downtown Jersey City, Van Vorst Park",Hudson,34017,,,,Zillow,,,,,,"Jersey City Public School District, Great Futures Charter School",http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f874091648od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75,"http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f874091648od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f4147790159od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f2621444934od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f982321511od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f3197030889od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f593923316od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f1825393703od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f550678278od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f554409984od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f1590279455od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f2090605124od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f1798216301od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f3328266990od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f414438627od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f2589302318od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f28971990od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f4175681052od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f1525466927od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f2915810656od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f4263867711od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f3997711138od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f351031294od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f3204051505od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f2594614017od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f2027477897od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f1006030498od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f2542912571od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f4170218731od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f1623498974od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f2275966792od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ar.rdcpix.com/399a5e6b01cb2582c941d5aef53ae22fc-f3924963115od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75"
